        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We aim to help cattle producers, feedlot managers, and direct-market beef sellers make practical decisions using clear, simple estimator tools. The agribusiness environment requires careful planning; we provide the calculators to simplify complex economic forecasting.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Shared Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
          This application shares branding, core philosophy, and legal frameworks with the broader Rural Utility Cost website. We believe in providing trustworthy, rural-focused tools that are accessible everywhere, particularly securely on mobile devices out in the field.
